To start this project you will need to install Maven, NPM and Angular-cli

After installing

Go to the root folder "ng2boot" and digit 'mvn clean install'
Go to the path "ng2boot/backend" and digit 'mvn spring-boot:run',
now we have the spring-boot running
Go to the path "ng2boot/frontend/src/main/frontend" and digit 'npm start'
now we have our frontend-test server running

For now that's all
